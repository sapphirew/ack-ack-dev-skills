# ACK Development Guide

## Overview

AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK) lets you manage AWS resources directly from Kubernetes. It consists of three components:

1. **Runtime** - Shared library: base controller logic, AWS SDK integration, reconciliation framework
2. **Code Generator** - Generates CRDs, Go types, controller logic, and SDK bindings from AWS API models
3. **Service Controllers** - Individual controllers per AWS service, built from generated code + custom hooks

```
AWS API Model → Code Generator → Generated Code → Controller
     ↓              ↓              ↓
  service.json  generator.yaml  CRDs + Go types
```

## Working Conventions

1. **Use available resources** - Ask if local clones of upstream repos are available before trying to fetch remote content.
2. **Feed the skill** - When you discover gaps, new patterns, or fixes not covered here, propose updating the relevant file in this skill (SKILL.md or references/). Capture what you learned so the next session benefits.

## Required Reading by Task

Before starting work, read the reference file for your task. These contain patterns distilled from 6,300+ PR review comments that prevent common mistakes.

## Golden Rules

These apply everywhere. They are not repeated in individual sections.

**Never manually edit generated files.** All files in `apis/v1alpha1/`, `pkg/resource/`, `config/crd/`, `config/rbac/`, `helm/`, and `cmd/controller/main.go` are generated and will be overwritten. If something's wrong, fix `generator.yaml` and rebuild.

**Edit only these:**
- `generator.yaml` - All resource configuration
- `templates/hooks/` - Custom hook templates (if needed)
- `test/e2e/` - E2E tests

**Always use `make build-controller`** from the code-generator directory. It handles everything in one shot: API types, controller code, deepcopy, CRDs, RBAC, Helm chart, gofmt, and go mod tidy. Individual `ack-generate` commands can leave partial state.

```bash
# From code-generator directory
SERVICE=<service> AWS_SDK_GO_VERSION=v1.41.0 make build-controller
```

Set `AWS_SDK_GO_VERSION` explicitly for reproducibility. Use the core SDK version (`github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2`), not the service-specific version.

**Only configure non-default fields in generator.yaml.** If a field uses all defaults (mutable, no references, etc.), don't add it. Less config = less maintenance.

**Squash commits before final push:**
```bash
git reset --soft <base-commit>
git commit -m "add support for <Resource> resource"
git push --force origin <branch>
```

---

## Adding a New Field to a CRD

**Before starting:** Identify the AWS API field, check if it's already in the CRD, review similar fields for patterns.

**Steps:**
1. Update `generator.yaml` (only if field needs non-default behavior)
2. Rebuild: `SERVICE=<svc> AWS_SDK_GO_VERSION=<ver> make build-controller`
3. Check generated code: `git diff apis/v1alpha1/` and `git diff config/crd/`
4. Add custom logic if needed in `pkg/resource/<resource>/hooks.go`
5. Add tests and test locally: `make test`

**Renaming Fields for Better UX:**

AWS API field names often include redundant prefixes (e.g., `BackupVaultName`). ACK allows renaming to more idiomatic Kubernetes names.

```yaml
resources:
  BackupVault:
    fields:
      Name:
        is_primary_key: true
    renames:
      operations:
        CreateBackupVault:
          input_fields:
            BackupVaultName: Name
            BackupVaultTags: Tags
        DeleteBackupVault:
          input_fields:
            BackupVaultName: Name
        DescribeBackupVault:
          input_fields:
            BackupVaultName: Name
```

**Important:** Add renames for ALL operations that use the field (Create, Read, Update, Delete, List).

**Renaming primary key fields:** Requires both the renamed field key in `fields:` AND renames on every operation. For AWS-assigned identifiers (output-only fields like `BackupPlanId`), include `output_fields` renames on Create and Get, plus `input_fields` renames on Get, Update, and Delete. Missing any operation causes cryptic code-gen errors like `could not find field with path`.

**Common field patterns:**
- **Immutable fields**: Check AWS API docs carefully - a field being "required" in Update doesn't mean it's mutable. Primary keys and lookup identifiers are almost always immutable.
- **References to other resources**: Use `AWSResourceReferenceWrapper` type via `references` config in generator.yaml.
- **Sensitive data**: Store in Secrets, reference from spec.

**Field Immutability - How to Verify:**

A field should be marked `is_immutable: true` if:
1. AWS API docs say "cannot be changed" or "immutable"
2. The field is a primary key or lookup identifier (even if required in Update)
3. Testing with AWS CLI shows the field cannot be updated

**Nested Response Handling (`output_wrapper_field_path`):**

Some AWS APIs wrap responses in a nested object. Use `output_wrapper_field_path` to flatten them. See [code-generation.md](references/code-generation.md) for full details and examples.

**Nested Input Handling (`input_wrapper_field_path`):**

Some AWS APIs wrap input fields in a nested structure. Use `input_wrapper_field_path` to flatten the wrapper's fields into the CRD Spec. See [code-generation.md](references/code-generation.md) for internals, limitations, and handling fields outside the wrapper.

---

## Configuring Tags Support

**Important:** Not all resources support tagging via the TagResource API. Check AWS documentation first.

```bash
aws <service> tag-resource help
# Look for: "Currently, the only supported resource is..."
```

**For resources that support TagResource:**
```yaml
resources:
  Repository:
    tags:
      ignore: false  # Default
```

**For resources that do NOT support TagResource:**
```yaml
resources:
  RepositoryCreationTemplate:
    tags:
      ignore: true
```

**Special case:** Some resources have a field for tags applied to OTHER resources they create (e.g., ECR RepositoryCreationTemplate's `resourceTags`). The template still needs `tags.ignore: true`.

---

## Implementing Cross-Resource References

**When to use:** One ACK resource needs to reference another (e.g., EC2 instance referencing a VPC).

```yaml
resources:
  RepositoryCreationTemplate:
    fields:
      CustomRoleARN:
        references:
          resource: Role
          service_name: iam
          path: Status.ACKResourceMetadata.ARN
```

The code-generator handles reference resolution automatically. The generated code creates a `CustomRoleRef` field alongside `CustomRoleARN` and resolves the reference at reconciliation time.

**ACK convention:** Return error on invalid reference, don't create resource.

**Same-service references: do NOT set `service_name`.** When referencing a resource in the same controller (e.g., BackupPlan referencing BackupVault), omit `service_name`. Setting it (even correctly, e.g., `service_name: backup`) causes the generated code to produce an unresolved import alias (`backupapitypes`) and a compile error. Without `service_name`, code-gen correctly uses the local API types. Only set `service_name` for cross-service references (e.g., IAM Role, KMS Key).

---

## Error Codes and Custom Hooks

**Prefer `exceptions.errors` over custom hooks for error code mapping.**

Many AWS APIs return non-standard error codes for 404 (not found). Use `exceptions.errors.404.code` in generator.yaml:

```yaml
resources:
  BackupVault:
    exceptions:
      errors:
        404:
          code: AccessDeniedException  # DescribeBackupVault returns 403 for non-existent vaults
  BackupPlan:
    exceptions:
      errors:
        404:
          code: ResourceNotFoundException
```

**Custom hooks** are for cases where declarative config isn't enough (e.g., complex conditional logic, extra API calls).

1. Create hook template: `templates/hooks/<resource>/sdk_<hook_point>.go.tpl`
2. Reference in generator.yaml:
   ```yaml
   resources:
     BackupPlan:
       hooks:
         sdk_update_post_build_request:
           template_path: hooks/backup_plan/sdk_update_post_build_request.go.tpl
   ```
3. Rebuild (custom templates are picked up automatically by `make build-controller`)

**Hook template must use renamed fields:** If you renamed fields in generator.yaml, use the new names (e.g., `r.ko.Spec.Name` not `r.ko.Spec.BackupVaultName`). See [troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md) "Hook Variable Names by SDK Method" for correct variable names per hook point.

**Common hook points:**
- `sdk_read_one_post_request` - After reading resource from AWS
- `sdk_create_pre_build_request` / `sdk_create_post_build_request` - Before/after building create input
- `sdk_update_pre_build_request` / `sdk_update_post_build_request` - Before/after building update input
- `sdk_delete_pre_build_request` - Before building delete input

## Scripts

Run these from the service controller directory:

- **`scripts/build-controller.sh <service> [sdk-version] [codegen-path]`** - Builds a controller with correct env vars. Auto-detects code-generator location. Builds `ack-generate` if needed.
- **`scripts/verify-build.sh`** - Post-build check: compiles the controller, reports changed files by area, warns if Helm chart wasn't updated.
- **`scripts/setup-e2e.sh`** - Creates Python venv, installs test dependencies and setuptools. Handles the Python 3.13+ gotcha.
